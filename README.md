# Hearthstone Cards in JSON Format

This is the output from another Hearthstone JSON tool, [found here](http://hearthstonejson.com/) ([or on github 
here](https://github.com/Sembiance/hearthstonejson)). I just ran the tool with the latest patch (2.3.0.8108 as of 
this writing) since the output was slightly out of date in the other tool. Assuming I remember to do so I'll reapply 
the changes after every patch (or possibly automate that if I can find the time to do so).

## XML Output

The original tool output to JSON which is nice, but I thought it might be useful to have it in XML format as well. 
Just using a simple python utility to perform that translation so it's not perfect, but serviceable.
